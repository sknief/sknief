### Hi! My name is Stella and I am a queer scholar and programmer

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the first chapter of my PhD! I am looking at the energetic requirements of an immune response in fish. <br/>
ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are She/They. <br/>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript. <br/>
ðŸ¦‘ I'm confident in R, Eidos, Shell, Powershell, LaTeX and Papyrus. <br/>


<br/>

ðŸ“« How to reach me: through the twitter linked to my profile.<br/>
âš¡ Fun fact: you can support me and my work by buying me a coffee through Ko-fi! <br/>
