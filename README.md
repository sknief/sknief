### Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently not learning any new language. <br/>
🦑 I'm confident in R, Eidos, Shell, Powershell, LaTeX and Papyrus. <br/>
🔭 I’m currently working on the first chapter of my PhD! I am looking at the energetic requirements of an immune response in fish. <br/>

<br/>

📫 How to reach me: through the twitter linked to my profile.<br/>
⚡ Fun fact: you can support me and buy me a coffee through Ko-fi! <br/>
