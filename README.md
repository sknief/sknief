### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning LaTeX!
ğŸ¦‘ I'm confident in Shell, Powershell, R, Eidos, and Papyrus. 
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the first chapter of my PhD! I am looking at the energetic requirements of an immune response in fish. 

ğŸ˜„ My pronouns are She/They!
ğŸ“« How to reach me: through the twitter linked to my profile!
